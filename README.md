Embedded V8 JavaScript Engine
=============
This is a stripped down version of Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
The purpose of this repo is to simplify the build process to make it
eaiser to embed v8 in other projects.  This repo will likely fall
behind the latest v8 releases.  See the real v8 repo for more info.
